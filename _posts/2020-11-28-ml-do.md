description: Data is everywhere. Understanding it; however, is a whole different story. If a company is going to succeed in business intelligence it must develop a data-centric culture that encourages its employees to question, research, and resolve issues. To do this, companies must be willing to be transparent on their data needs, resolve data issues, and understand where their data capabilities fall short.

Machine Learning is a powerful technology that extracts information from historical data to give you insights like customer data, predictive behaviors and forecasts.

Decision Optimization is a powerful tool that uses the outcome of machine learning and prescribes the next set of decisions to take based on account laws, constraints, regulations and trade-offs between business objectives.

# Using a Predictive and Prescriptive Workflow for Marketing Campaign Optimization

In this example, the business wants to contact a customer and propose a product. The marketing team needs to decide:

* Who should be contacted
* Which product should be proposed per customer
* How a customer should be contacted
* How to optimize a limited budget
* Is this campaign profitable

The workflow of this project should include the following:
* Uploading historical data to train machine learning
* Applying a predictive model to new customer data
* Applying a decision optimization model to find out which products should be offered to which customer through which channel
* Visualization and analysis of the model

# Step 1: Understand the Historical Data
First you will want to load the historical data, and use it to train a classifier to predict future sales.
