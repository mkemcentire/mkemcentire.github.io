**Data is everywhere.** Understanding it; however, is a whole different story. If a company is going to succeed in business intelligence it must develop a data-centric culture that encourages its employees to question, research, and resolve issues. To do this, companies must be willing to be transparent on their data needs, resolve data issues, and understand where their data capabilities fall short. 

Long gone are the days of throwing an idea at the wall and hoping it sticks. Data isn't just the future - data is *now*. More companies are moving towards business intelligence. This means that they have an understanding of their data, or at the very least, they have a team of people that do. This team then crafts a compelling story using data visualization to argue their point. This team can bring actionable insights to the table to encourage management to make real decisions to better the companies marketing and sales activities. This team researches and plans and understands that to drive the company forward, they must rely on good data. These people are data driven, and they are the cornerstone to business success - now - and in the future.

Data analysis isn't for everyone, but you can still encourage your team to be data-centric. Here's what it takes:

# Be Data Literate
What is data literacy? Data literacy is the ability to read, work with, analyze, and argue with data. As data analysis and big data become common ideas in business it underscores the importance for people to have some data literacy. This simply means that all of your people should be able to read and interpret graphs, charts, surveys and studies even if you leave the analysis and visualization to a select few.

# Be Curious
Data will tell you what works and what doesn't. In business, we can be quick to jump to a conclusion that directly aligns with our business goals. We tend to settle, rather than dig deeper where a whole new treasure trove of customer information could be. Being curious gives you an open mind to explore new possibilities, deeper patterns, anomalies and find actionable insights into customer behavior.

# Be Action Oriented
Create long lasting solutions with your team by implementing objectives and key results. When you set up OKRs, you're setting up metric based indicators of success for your team which encourages accountability for all team members including management. Setting these kinds of goals can be as broad or specific as you'd like. *For example: this quarter, let's increase website traffic by x%.* This is a great opportunity to keep your team members informed about how their work is contributing to this goal. When people see results, they are more motivated to keep working hard.

# Communicate More
Data can help you prove a point. It can also help your team re-align. Communication is key to business success, but it is also something that I feel like most businesses struggle with. Going back to a point made earlier, keeping your team informed on how they're contributing to the company as a whole is a great motivator. When you open the lines of communication with your team you will start to see more collaboration, honesty, and transparency between team members. Everyone wants to be reassured that their job matters. And it all starts with you!

# Be Skeptical
Data helps you prove your team's value. Data not only needs to be understood, it needs to be visualized if you want to prove a point. When it comes to visualization, you can (and should!) ask questions like:

* Does this make sense on a general level?
* Are the metrics I'm seeing in line with what I already know about the business?
* Is there a key takeaway?

Being skeptical means asking questions about the data, and how the team sourced that data. Reassure your team that this isn't a time to trash anyone's work ethic or effort. It's about making sure that the story you are crafting is a compelling one. If you ask the hard questions in the beginning, then your whole team is prepared to answer them later when asked by another interested party. Pushing your whole team to be skeptical about the data allows your team to grow and to start thinking critically. When you have a team of critical thinkers, you will find that their self determination, motivation and curiousity grow along with them.
