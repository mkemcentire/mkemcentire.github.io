**Data is everywhere.** Unfortunately businesses underutilize the data they have due to a lack of understanding and data governance. As companies move more towards business intelligence, it's important that a company's culture becomes more data-centric. We also need to understand our data first. We need to resolve data issues and _understand where our data capabilities fall short_. Having a full understanding of our data will help us avoid telling an incomplete, misleading, or inaccurate story. No matter how well presented our data is, if it does not tell the right story, then users will not get value from them. 

To become more data driven, companies should encourage their employees to research concepts, create a plan, and come to the table with actionable insights - instead of continuing to throw an idea at the wall and hope it sticks.  

So, how do you encourage your team to be more data driven? Here are 5 key characteristics of data driven people.

# Be Data Literate
What is data literacy? Data literacy is the ability to read, work with, analyze, and argue with data. This concept focuses on the competencies that are involved in working with data. In short, being data literate will allow you to see your business more clearly.

But this can be a challenge for businesses especially for marketing purposes. Modern day marketing relies on personalization, but due to a lack of data literacy it is projected that 80% of marketers will drop personalization efforts by 2025.

This prediction doesn't deny the appeal of personalization as a marketing tactic, rather it _underscores_ the growing frustrations surrounding reliable data.

# Be Curious
Data will tell you what works and what doesn't. In business, we can be quick to jump to a conclusion that directly aligns with our business goal. We settle, rather than dig deeper where a whole new treasure trove of customer information could be.

Being curious gives you an open mind to explore new possibilities, deeper patterns, anomalies and find actionable insights into customer behavior. When you look outside the lines, you can unearth some great data.

# Be Action Oriented
Using data will keep your team on track. Create long lasting solutions with your team by implementing objectives and key results. Doing so gets your team moving in one direction. When you set up OKRs, you're setting up metric based indicators of success for your team which encourages accountability on all levels.

Setting clear objectives gives your employees specific targets to aim for, keeps them engaged and motivated because they now know what success is supposed to look like. Setting these kinds of goals can be as broad or specific as you'd like. For example: let's "increase website traffic by x%". This is also a great opportunity to keep your team members informed about how their work is contributing to this goal. When people see results, they are more motivated to keep working hard.

# Communicate More
Data can help you prove a point. It can also help your team re-align. Communication is something that I feel like most businesses struggle with in general. Going back to a point made earlier, keeping your team informed on how they're contributing to the company as a whole is a great motivator. 

When you open the lines of communication with your team you will start to see more collaboration, honesty, and transparency between team members. Everyone wants to be reassured that their job matters. It all starts with you!

# Be Skeptical
Data helps you prove your team's value. Data not only needs to be understood, it needs to be visualized if you want to prove a point. When it comes to visualization, you can (and should!) ask questions like:

* Does this make sense on a general level?
* Are the metrics I'm seeing in line with what I already know about the business?
* Is there a key takeaway?

Being skeptical isn't a time to trash anyone's work ethic or effort. Pushing your whole team to be skeptical about the data allows your team to grow and to start thinking critically. When you have a team of critical thinkers, you will find that their self determination, motivation and curiousity grow along with them.
